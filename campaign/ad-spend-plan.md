# Ad Spend & Campaign Strategy: Scaling the 3.5%
🎯 1. Campaign Objective
To mobilize 2.35 million UK citizens into a unified, non-partisan voting bloc.

The campaign is designed to move supporters through a three-stage funnel: Awareness, Education, and Mobilization.

📈 2. Phased Spend Allocation:

The budget is deployed across four distinct "Year" cycles, with intensity increasing as we approach a General Election.

🗓️ Phase 1: The Awareness "Ignition" (Year 1):

Focus: Highlighting the "Energy Injustice" and the logic of the NRF.

Messaging: "Why is your standing charge so high?" and "The UK should own its own energy."

Channels: Meta (Facebook/Instagram) for broad demographic reach; YouTube for "Deep Dive" explainers.

KPI: 500,000 email sign-ups and 10 million unique video views.

🗓️ Phase 2: The Coalition Build (Year 2–3):

Focus: Targeting the "Social Leadership Tier" and high-influence professionals.

Messaging: Highlighting the CSR Partnership and the Patriotic Dividend.

Channels: LinkedIn for corporate leaders; Podcast sponsorships (UK politics/economics focus).

KPI: 1.5 million supporters and 100+ "Founding Partner" corporations.

🗓️ Phase 3: The "3.5% Ultimatum" (Year 4)

Focus: Reaching the 2.35m threshold and deploying the political mandate.

Messaging: "We are 2.35 million strong. Which party wants our vote?"

Channels: Geographic targeting in Swing Seats; Out-of-Home (OOH) billboards in key constituencies.

KPI: 2.35 million verified supporters and 75% national brand recognition.

🗺️ 3. Geographic & Demographic Targeting

To maximize political leverage, ad spend is not distributed evenly. It is weighted toward:

🚩 Swing Seats: Focusing on constituencies where a 3.5% shift in the vote determines the winner.

🏭 Industrial Heartlands: Areas most impacted by high energy overheads (North East, Midlands, Scotland).

👨‍👩‍👧 The "Squeezed Middle": Households earning £30k–£70k who feel the maximum impact of energy price volatility.

📣 4. Creative Strategy: The "Alternative Vision"

Every time a government or regulator announces a price hike or a new levy, the campaign triggers a Rapid Response creative:

The Contrast: "They gave you a £30 boiler tax. We offer a £80bn National Asset."

The Dashboard: Using snippets of the National Energy Dashboard to show what "could be" built with the same capital.

🛡️ 5. Trust and Verification

To maintain the integrity of the 2.35m figure, the campaign utilizes:

Double-Opt-In Verification: Ensuring every "supporter" is a unique, verified UK resident.

Zero-Risk Privacy: Messaging clearly states that no sensitive data is stored, only the "Mandate Pledge" to vote for the NRF.
