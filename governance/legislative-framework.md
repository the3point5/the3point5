# Legislative Framework: The "Double-Lock" Independence

1 - Statutory Establishment
The National Renewal Fund (NRF) shall be established via a dedicated Act of Parliament. This legislation defines the NRF as an independent statutory body, legally distinct from the Treasury and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. Its primary mandate is the stewardship and expansion of the UK’s energy asset base.

2 - The "Double-Lock" Governance Mechanism
To ensure the Fund is never liquidated or repurposed for short-term political spending, the NRF is protected by a dual-layered security architecture.

Lock 1: Parliamentary Supermajority: Any legislative amendment to the NRF’s core purpose, the Sunset Clause, or its capital ring-fencing requires a two-thirds supermajority vote in the House of Commons.

Lock 2: Independent Board Approval: Even with a supermajority, no changes can be enacted without the formal, written consent of the NRF Board of Trustees, an apolitical body composed of infrastructure, legal, and industrial experts.

3 - Asset Ring-Fencing and Fiscal Integrity
The Framework creates a "Legal Firewall" around the Fund’s capital.

Non-Diversion Clause: By law, NRF capital and operational surpluses cannot be transferred into the Consolidated Fund or used to offset general government borrowing.

Asset Protection: The energy assets (storage facilities, generation plants, and grids) are held in a permanent public trust. They cannot be privatized or sold without meeting the supermajority and Board approval requirements.

4 - The Sunset Clause: Trigger-Based Decommissioning
The legislation includes a "Success-Bound Sunset Clause." The authority to collect decadal contributions is not indefinite; it is legally tied to performance metrics.

Trigger A: The Fund achieves a verified asset valuation of £80 billion.

Trigger B: The Fund generates a consistent net operating surplus of £4 billion per annum.

Automatic Rescission: Once either trigger is met, the statutory power to levy contributions is automatically rescinded, and the Fund shifts to a 100% self-financing model.

5 - Transparency and Digital Oversight
The Act mandates the maintenance of the National Energy Dashboard.

Real-Time Audit: The Dashboard must provide live data on capital deployment, asset construction progress, and revenue generation.

Public Reporting: An annual "State of the Fund" report must be delivered to the public, detailing how the "Patriotic Dividend" is being applied to reduce household and industrial energy costs.

6 - The 120-Day Compliance Window
The framework allows for a "Self-Correction" period immediately following the Act’s commencement. This provides a legal pathway for individuals and corporations to declare their assets and move from the Statutory Tier (2%) to the Voluntary Tier (1%), ensuring high initial compliance and collaborative implementation.
