# The National Renewal Manifesto: A Social Contract for Sovereignty
The Vision: A Legacy of Energy Independence
For too long, the United Kingdom has been at the mercy of global energy markets and chronic underinvestment. The National Renewal Fund (NRF) is our generation’s answer: a permanent, publicly owned investment vehicle designed to build a national green energy asset base that belongs to the people of this country.

This is not a temporary subsidy or a government grant. It is a national energy endowment—a self-sustaining shield that will lower energy bills, protect British industry, and secure our sovereignty for generations to come.

🗳️ The Power of 3.5%: Our Democratic Mandate
History shows that when 3.5% of a population unites behind a single goal, systemic change becomes inevitable.


The Target: 2.35 million UK citizens.


The Pledge: A unified voting bloc committed to one objective—voting for whichever party officially adopts the NRF into its manifesto.

The Ultimatum: When we reach the 3.5% threshold, we present a 72-hour window for party leaders to commit. We are not just asking for change; we are making it the price of entry for those who wish to govern.

🤝 The Social Contract: A Patriotic Dividend
The NRF is built on the principle of Public Reciprocity. We believe those who have gained the most from the UK’s economy should have the high honour of securing its future.

🏛️ The Contribution
Every ten years, the wealthiest individuals (net assets >£100m) and largest UK-facing corporations (revenue >£25m) will provide a one-off capital contribution. This is a time-limited mission to capitalise a permanent asset, not an open-ended tax.

📈 The Reciprocal Benefit
In exchange for this stewardship, the nation receives:


Immediate Grid Stability: Prioritising grid-scale storage to eliminate volatility and lower standing charges.

Industrial Competitiveness: Slashing energy overheads for SMEs and manufacturers to protect British jobs.

The Household Dividend: Applying operational surpluses directly to residential bill reduction.

⚖️ The Double-Lock: Protection Beyond Politics
To ensure this asset is never raided for short-term political gains, the NRF is protected by a statutory "Double-Lock".

Independent Governance: Led by infrastructure experts and arm's-length from the Treasury.

Dual Mandate: Any change to the Fund’s purpose requires a supermajority in Parliament and formal approval from the Independent Board.

⌛ The Sunset Clause: A Mission with an End
The NRF is a build-and-finish project. Once the Fund achieves a £80bn asset base and a £4bn annual surplus, it becomes fully self-financing. At that moment, the contribution mechanism is permanently rescinded.

We build the asset. We secure the country. We finish the job. 

🚀 The Time is Now
The choice is simple: continue with the status quo of volatile bills and national exposure, or join the 3.5% and build a permanent foundation of wealth for the United Kingdom.

"Securing the Future through National Unity."
