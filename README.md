# The 3.5% Movement & National Renewal Fund (NRF)
Welcome to the Strategic HQ for the 3.5% Movement. This repository houses the high-level blueprints and governance frameworks for the National Renewal Fund (NRF)—a project dedicated to securing long-term national energy independence and public wealth across the United Kingdom.

🎯 The Mission
Our objective is to unify 2.35 million people (3.5% of the total UK population) behind a single, non-partisan mandate for national renewal. 

**Methodology:** The 2.35m figure is calculated against the total UK population of ~68 million to meet the "3.5% Rule" for guaranteed social and legislative shift.

🏛️ Strategic Pillars
📈 National Endowment
Focusing on the creation of a self-sustaining asset base that provides a permanent surplus for the British public, ensuring the UK is never again at the mercy of global price volatility.

🗳️ The Power of 3.5%
Utilising the proven "3.5% Rule" of social change to create a unified voting bloc that is too large for any political party to ignore.

⚖️ Protected Governance
Developing a "Double-Lock" framework that ensures the fund's assets are statutorily protected and cannot be liquidated or redirected by short-term political interests.
