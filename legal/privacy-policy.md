# Privacy Policy: The 3.5% Movement & NRF
⚖️ 1. Our Privacy Philosophy: "Data Minimalism"

The 3.5% Movement is built on the principle of Data Minimalism. We believe that your participation in a democratic mandate should not come at the cost of your personal privacy. We only collect the absolute minimum information required to verify your status as a UK resident and to validate our 2.35 million supporter threshold.

🔍 2. Information We Collect

To maintain the integrity of the "3.5% Mandate" while protecting your identity, we collect:

Verification Data: Name and UK Postcode (used solely to map supporters to Swing Seats).

Contact Data: An email address or mobile number for critical movement updates and the final "Voting Instructions."

Pledge Status: A simple "Yes/No" record of your support for the National Renewal Fund.

We do NOT collect: National Insurance numbers, specific street addresses, financial records, or browsing history.

🔐 3. Security and Encryption

Your data is stored using AES-256 military-grade encryption.

🚫 Zero External Access: We do not sell, rent, or trade your data with third parties, political parties, or government agencies.

🛡️ 2FA Protected: Access to the supporter database is restricted to a handful of "Security Cleared" administrators via mandatory Two-Factor Authentication.

📍 4. Geographic Mapping (The "Bloc" Logic)

We use your postcode to aggregate supporters into "Constituency Blocs."

Public Dashboard: The National Energy Dashboard only displays anonymised counts (e.g., "3,400 supporters in Manchester Central").

Individual Privacy: No individual's identity or specific location is ever revealed on public-facing tools.

⌛ 5. Data Retention and the Sunset Clause

Your data is held only for as long as the movement is active.

Mission Success: Once the NRF is enshrined in law and the Sunset Clause is triggered, the 3.5% Movement database will be permanently purged and destroyed.

The Right to be Forgotten: You may withdraw your pledge and request the immediate deletion of your data at any time via a simple "One-Click" removal tool.

6 EU GDPR and UK Data Rights

We operate in full compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). You have the right to:

Access the data we hold about you.

Correct any inaccuracies.

Object to specific processing of your data.

Request data portability.

📢 7. Policy Updates

As the movement scales toward the 2.35 million threshold, we may update this policy to reflect new security technologies. Any major changes will be broadcast directly to all supporters via the National Energy Dashboard.
